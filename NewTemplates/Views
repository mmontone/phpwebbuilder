When a component wants to render:

- It first checks for it's view. It should have one, and a location for it. 
	If it doesn't, It gets one (via ViewCreator).
	
- It calls recursively.

- When a component calls (or callbacks) another one, it creates a holder in 
	it's position, with it's id. Then calls the other component for creating 
	it's view.
	
TODO:

- A function to parse a text and create the corresponding template for an element.
- Make sure we're using the most particular template for the class (sort them).
