The renderer should work this way, with a single object:

It tells the Structure to show the header,

Then, for each field, 
- it asks the Structure to show the start of the field wrapper
- it asks the Action to show the field, 
- and the Linker to show the corresponding Links.
- it asks the Structure to show the end of the field wrapper

It then tells the Structure to show the footer.

The renderer should work this way, with a collection:

It tells the Structure to show the header,

Then, for each field, 
- it asks the Structure to show the start of the object wrapper
- it asks the ¿Action? to show the object*, 
- and the Linker to show the corresponding Links.
- it asks the Structure to show the end of the object wrapper

It then tells the Structure to show the footer.


* Yes, because we can make a view to edit multiple objects at the same time.

Who takes cake of permissions? I Think the renderer (may have to change in the future).

Can I select which links to add? Not right Now.
