Implement in-memory collections suport.

The current problem:
1) We want to be able to add things to collections in-memory.
And then work with them with the reports interface.
Requirements: related reports should all filter the same collection.
I mean, all reports which work on users should work on the same global collection (the collection of all users).
That way reports remain updated as users are added or removed from that collection.
