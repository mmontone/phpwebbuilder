Optimizations:

ToDo:
- ajax.js has "admin" as pwb_url. Think a way to work it around.
- Templates: Buttons should stay right below table. tfooter?
- Checkboxes, and edit or delete many elements at the same time (ShowCollectionComponent).
- (ShowCollectionComponent): Elements should be added by the id on the class (so consecutive actions, like deletions, can be carried out).
