ToDo:
- Reinsert permissions into DefaultCMS
- XML With ID but without controller shoudn't display itself.
- Collection
- PersistentColleciton extends Collection (cache of objects).
- Select (uses Collection). Object to string Method and var to String Function
- ajax.js has "admin" as pwb_url. Think a way to work it around.
- Templates: Buttons shouldd stay tight below table. tfooter?
- Checkboxes, and edit or delete many elements at the same time (ShowCollectionComponent).
- Action Validation on delete
- uploadFile.php should call to functions on the parent document (start_uploading, end_uploading, upload_error).
