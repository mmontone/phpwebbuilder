Optimizations:


*htmltemplate->xml2template
*xmlnodemodificationstracker->flushmodifications


ToDo:
- Reinsert permissions into DefaultCMS
- XML With ID but without controller shoudn't display itself.
- Collection
- PersistentColleciton extends Collection (cache of objects).
- Select (uses Collection). Object to string Method and var to String Function
- ajax.js has "admin" as pwb_url. Think a way to work it around.
- Templates: Buttons shouldd stay tight below table. tfooter?
- Texts with "<" or ">" are not ajax-displayed correctly.
- Strings printed break ajax code when contain an &,
		but adding an &->&amp; breaks other string conversion.
